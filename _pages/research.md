Gyrokinetic simulation of instabilities and turbulence in stellarator plasmas
===========
Stellarators are a type of magnetic confinement devices that can generate rotational transform without the plasma current. Stellarators have regained popularity in recent years after the successful construction and operation of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) device in Greifswald, Germany. Just like tokamaks, turbulent transport significantly affects the plasma temperature in optimized stellarators. However, unlike tokamaks, stellarators are nonaxisymmetric and the detailed behavior of turbulence often differ. We have studied the linear eigenmode structure of ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes in stellarators using the global gyrokinetic [GTC](https://sun.ps.uci.edu/gtc/) simulations. We found that the ITG eigenmode structures are nonuniform on flux surfaces and can be explained from the WKB (ray-tracing) theory from Dewar and Glasser ([1983](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.864028)). Intuitively, the poloidal wavenumber of the mode becomes complex due to nonaxisymmetry, which is a distinct feature in stellarator plasmas.
