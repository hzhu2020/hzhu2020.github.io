About me
======
I am a Tenure-track Assistant Professor at Institute for Fusion Theory and Simulation, School of Physics, Zhejiang University.

Research interests
==
I study theoretical and computational plasma physics and specialize in gyrokinetic simulations of magnetic confinement fusion plasmas. I am generally interested in theoretical understanding of the simulation results, as well as in advanced numerical methods in application to gyrokinetic simulations.

Openings
======
Positions are available for postdocs and students.
